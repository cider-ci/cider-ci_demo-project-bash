executions:

  "All":
    description: >
      This execution runs all the tasks defined in this project. 
    specification:
      _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/all_spec.yml

  "Attachments-Demo": 
    description: >
      This execution demonstrates the usage of the `tree_attachments` and
      `trial_attachments` directive.  It creates a file which is then attached
      as a tree- as well as a trial-attachment. 
    specification:
      name: Attachments Demo
      task_defaults:
        traits:
          linux: true
      tasks:
        _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/tasks/attachments.yml

  "Environment-Variables-Demo": 
    description: |
      This execution Demonstrates the usage of the `environment_variables`
      directive.  It specifies a tasks which lists the environment variables
      with `env | sort`. 
    specification:
      name: Environment Variables Demo
      task_defaults:

        _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/tasks/environment_variables.yml

  "Exclusive-Global-Resources-Demo": 
    description: |
      This execution demonstrates the `exclusive_global_resources` directive.
      Two tasks declare exclusive access to `/tmp/timestamps.log`.  The
      `eager_trials` directive is used to generate effectively four trials.  At
      any time at **most one** trial is _executing_. This can be verified by
      the timestamps in the attachments. 
    specification: 
      _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/shared/exclusive_global_resources_context.yml

  "Info": 
    description: >
      This execution runs a few tasks which show various information, e.g.
      `ls`, `git log`, ...
    specification:
      name: Show info
      task_defaults:
        traits:

      tasks:
        _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/tasks/infos.yml

  "Ports-Demo":
    description: >
      This execution demonstrates the usage of the `ports` directive.  The
      output of `env | sort` shows the assigned port as the value of the given
      name.
    specification:
      name: Ports Demo
      task_defaults:

        _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/tasks/ports.yml

  "Result-Demo":
    description: >
      This execution creates the specially treated `result.json` file with
      `value`, and `summary` properties.  It also attaches the `result.json` by
      the `trial_attachments` directive. 
    specification:
      name: Result Demo
      task_defaults:
        traits:
          linux: true
      tasks:
        _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/tasks/result.yml

  "Submodule-Demo":
    description: |
      This execution demonstrates  the usage of the `git_options`/`submodule`
      specification.  It also checks some properties of the checked out
      submodules and fails if they would not be present. 
    specification: 
      _cider-ci_include: /.cider-ci/shared/submodule_context.yml

  "Tests":
    description: >
      This executions runs several bash scripts. Some of them sleep for a
      while.  Some of them fail with a certain probability.  One of them
