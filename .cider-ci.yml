- name: Dependencies and Triggers Depends 
  description: |
    This demo can only be started if the "Dependencies and Triggers
    Prerequisite" has passed. There is also a corresponding trigger defined for

- name: Eager and Retry Demo
  decription: |
    This is a job with probabilistic outcome. The task in this job succeeds
    with probability 1/7. We try eagerly with 4 trials and retry up to 10
    times. The total probability of success for the job is hence about 79%.

- name: Exclusive Resources Demo
  description: |
    This job demonstrates the `exclusive_resources` directive.
    Two tasks declare exclusive access to `/tmp/timestamps.log`.  The
    `eager_trials` directive is used to generate effectively four trials.  At
    any time at **most one** trial is _executing_. This can be verified by
    the timestamps in the attachments.
